# Ubuntu Wordpress Server

In this repository, you can find wordpress optimized configurations for nginx including the support for SSL. It also includes a config file for oh-my-zsh and simple backup scripts for wordpress.

Usage of all the files is included in the documentation, but it is prepared for a setup on Amazon AWS. If you want to setup your server on other platforms, you can still use the files, but the server setup would be a little different.

PS: Don't forget that the version of the software used on this guide might have changed with time, so make sure you make the necessary adjustments on the commands.
